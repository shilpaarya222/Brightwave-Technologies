With the introduction of new, patient-friendly formulations such as preservative-free eye drops and single-use vials, the market is expected to see continued growth, particularly among individuals who are looking for alternative allergy treatments. <h3>Nasal Spray (Rhinitis)</h3><p>Sodium cromoglycate nasal sprays are a popular treatment for allergic rhinitis, a condition that affects millions of Americans each year. Allergic rhinitis is an allergic reaction that occurs when the immune system overreacts to airborne allergens, leading to symptoms like sneezing, nasal congestion, and runny nose. Nasal sprays containing sodium cromoglycate work by stabilizing mast cells in the nasal passages, preventing the release of histamine, and subsequently reducing inflammation and symptoms associated with the condition. The U.S. market for sodium cromoglycate nasal sprays has seen a steady increase as more individuals are diagnosed with allergic rhinitis, particularly due to environmental allergens such as pollen, dust mites, and mold. Sodium cromoglycate nasal sprays offer a non-systemic, localized solution that minimizes side effects while providing effective symptom relief. In recent years, the growing awareness of allergic rhinitis and its impact on quality of life has led to increased adoption of nasal sprays as an effective treatment option. Patients who prefer a more targeted approach to managing nasal symptoms associated with allergies are turning to sodium cromoglycate nasal sprays as a first-line treatment. Additionally, advancements in drug delivery technologies and formulation improvements have led to more convenient, user-friendly devices, such as metered-dose nasal spray pumps.
