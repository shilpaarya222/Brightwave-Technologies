E-commerce giants such as Amazon, Best Buy, and Home Depot are among the major players, providing consumers with the convenience of home delivery and access to a wide range of products.

The on-line subsegment is further bolstered by the ability of consumers to research products and read user experiences, thus facilitating informed purchase decisions. Additionally, with the ongoing rise of mobile shopping apps and enhanced digital payment systems, the demand for online purchases continues to grow, aligning with the modern, tech-savvy consumer’s preference for convenience and efficiency.</p><p>Online platforms also offer the advantage of increased customization, allowing consumers to choose specific features, styles, and price points that fit their needs. Furthermore, the wide availability of delivery and installation services through online retailers enhances the consumer experience, further driving the growth of this subsegment. As more consumers become comfortable with making significant purchases such as refrigerators online, the on-line market share in the U.S. is expected to continue growing.
